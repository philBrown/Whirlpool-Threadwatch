This is a simple web script to show summaries of selected Whirlpool broadband forum topics, preferably run in a browser's sidebar.

The script implements the Whirlpool forums web service API (http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1220737).

Users will need to enter their Whirlpool forums API key when prompted. This can be found under their Profile -> Preferences page,
located at http://whirlpool.net.au/profile/index.cfm?a=preferences.

Once authenticated, users may choose the forum topics they wish to monitor.
